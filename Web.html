            <p><b>Fernando Amorsolo y Cueto</b> was one of the most important artists in the history of painting in the Philippines. Labelled the country’s first National Artist in 1972 by then President Marcos, 
                Fernando Amorsolo is often known as the ‘Grand Old Man of Philippine Art’.  The Spanish-trained realist developed a backlighting technique, where his colorful depictions  of local people reflect the radiance of the Philippine sun. The figures and illuminated 
                landscapes magically glow on the canvas. Despite his deteriorating health and failing 
                eyesight, he remained prolific until the end, producing up to 10 paintings a month until his death at the age of 80.
                 Amorsolo’s creativity defines the nation’s culture and heritage to this day.</p>

                    of his work.

            <p><b>José T. Joya</b> a Filipino pioneer of Abstract expressionism, multi-media painter 
                José Joya uses bold and vibrant colours with a variety of painting techniques, 
                layering, loose impasto strokes and controlled drips. His harmonious colours are 
                influenced by Philippine landscapes and tropical wildlife. His mastery lies in 
                gestural paintings, where the paint is applied spontaneously on canvas, sometimes 
                directly out of the tube or through the use of broad strokes with brushes.</p>
                <p>
                    Joya influenced younger artists to explore other mediums such as pottery and 
                    printmaking while he served as the Dean of the College of Fine Arts at the University 
                    of the Philippines. In 1964, Joya represented the country in the Venice Biennial, 
                    showcasing the advancement of modern art in the Philippines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His most notable painting from 1958, called Granadean Arabesque, is a large scale yellow 
                    hued mural that features clusters of sand and impasto. It can be viewed at the Ateneo Art 
                    Gallery in Manila.

            <p><b>Pacita Barsana Abad</b> was an Ivatan and Philippine-American painter. Born on the northern island of Batanes, the internationally revered artist first 
                obtained a degree in Political Science at the University of the Philippines. Her 
                staunch activism against the Marcos regime in the 1970s, led her to move to San 
                Francisco to initially study law – but she found her true calling with art. Her 
                paintings consist of vibrant colors and a constant change of patterns and materials. 
                Earlier work dealt with socio-political depictions of people, indigenous masks, 
                tropical flowers, and underwater scenes. Pacita created a unique technique called 
                ‘trapunto’, where she stitches and stuffs her vibrant canvases with a wide range of 
                materials such as cloth, metal, beads, buttons, shells, glass and ceramics, to give 
                her work a three-dimensional look. Her many travels across the globe with her husband 
                have served as an inspiration for the techniques and materials used in her art. Pacita
                has participated in over 60 exhibitions across the United States, Latin America, and 
                Europe.
                <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp She is noted to have worked on more than 5,000 pieces of art – her masterwork being Alkaff Bridge, 
                Singapore, a 55-meter bridge covered in over 2,000 colourful circles. It was completed a few months 
                before she passed away from lung cancer in 2004.</p>
